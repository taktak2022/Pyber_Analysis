# Pyber_Analysis
## Module 5 Classwork Matplotlib
### Overview
The purpose of this module was to analyze the data for a ride-sharing company called PyBer (similar to "Uber"), worth an estimated $2.3 billion.  the data will be concentrated for the months of January to early May of 2019 for approximately 120 cities and population areas categorized as Urban, Suburban and Rural.  The analysis will also look at the differences, correlations and fluctuations of the number and cost of rides compared to the number of drivers for a designated area.

### Results of Data Analysis
The results of the analysis found the following totals of ride counts:
* Urban - 1625 rides
* Suburban - 625 rides
* Rural - 125 rides
The ride counts more than tripled in totals from Rural to Suburban areas; then almost tripled from Suburban to Urban areas.  This shows a clear demand for this ride share company as the population areas grow in number and area as well.

The results of the total number of drivers were as follows:
* Urban - 2405 drivers
* Suburban - 496 drivers
* Rural - 78 drivers
The number of drivers for each population area type also falls in line with the progression seen in the number of rides, increasing more than 500% from rural to suburban areas; then increasing more than 4 times from suburban to urban area driver totals.  This may increase as PyBer becomes more popular, or it could become more popular because of the increase in the number of drivers which would equate to more availability of the driver program.  There is potetial to increase its popularity in the rural and suburban areas as well.

The totals for fares revenue for each population area is as follows:
* Urban - $39854.38
* Suburban - $19356.33
* Rural - $4327.93
Although these are significant figures, when we see them broken down by month (see graph below), we will see that there are fluctuations within those months where the program seemed to be in more demand than in other weeks.
