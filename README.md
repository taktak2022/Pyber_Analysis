# Pyber_Analysis
## Module 5 Classwork Matplotlib
### Overview
The purpose of this module was to analyze the data for a ride-sharing company called PyBer (similar to "Uber"), worth an estimated $2.3 billion.  the data will be concentrated for the months of January to early May of 2019 for approximately 120 cities and population areas categorized as Urban, Suburban and Rural.  The analysis will also look at the differences, correlations and fluctuations of the number and cost of rides compared to the number of drivers for a designated area.

### Results of Data Analysis
The results of the analysis found the following totals of ride counts:
* Urban - 1625 rides
* Suburban - 625 rides
* Rural - 125 rides
The ride counts more than tripled in totals from Rural to Suburban areas; then almost tripled from Suburban to Urban areas.  This shows a clear demand for this ride share company as the population areas grow in number and area as well.

The results of the total number of drivers were as follows:
* Urban - 2405 drivers
* Suburban - 496 drivers
* Rural - 78 drivers
The number of drivers for each population area type also falls in line with the progression seen in the number of rides, increasing more than 500% from rural to suburban areas; then increasing more than 4 times from suburban to urban area driver totals.  This may increase as PyBer becomes more popular, or it could become more popular because of the increase in the number of drivers which would equate to more availability of the driver program.  There is potetial to increase its popularity in the rural and suburban areas as well.

The totals for fares revenue for each population area is as follows:
* Urban - $39854.38
* Suburban - $19356.33
* Rural - $4327.93
Although these are significant figures, when we see them broken down by month (see graph below), we will see that there are fluctuations within those months where the program seemed to be in more demand than in other weeks.

If we carefully examine the line graph we will see a gradual and fluctuating increase peaking at the mid to end of February mark for all three population areas.  This would fall in line with the major holiday of Valentine's Day for this period.  The actual day, February 14 falls on a weekday, Thursday for 2019.  Therefore we can speculate that many people would choose to celebrate it on the following weekend, starting with Friday the 15th to Sunday the 17th.  With couples wanting to celebrate it and the consumption of alcohol that would hinder driving, the use of the PyBer ride share program would be a logical conclusion.  This would be a major marketing point that we would emphasize for future earning potential.

The breakdown of the analysis for the average fares per drivers would be as follows:
* Urban - $55.49
* Suburban - $39.50
* Rural - $16.57
These average figures show that there is already healthy growth in the urban sectors.  There is potential for growth in the suburban and rural areas.

The average fare per ride breaks down as follows:
* Urban - $34.62
* Suburban - $30.97
* Rural - $24.53
* 
Here as well, we see that there is an $10 difference in average fare per ride breakdowns.  Further market research and possible marketing campaigns in the rural and suburban areas could be considered to increase these averages.  Possible customer target demographics could be suburban and rural families that share only one vehicle and cannot afford a second vehicle with its full-time costs associated with fuel, maintenance and insurance.  Another angle would be for teenagers who do not drive and/or do not own their own car.  This ride share program would be the perfect "vehicle" (pun intended) for a teenager to utilize on a weekend date to the mall to see a movie.

### Conclusions
As stated above, holiday periods when celebrating may be involved would be good oppurtunities to increase the marketshare of this program.  When we look at February and the way Valentine's Day may have stimulated the use of the PyBer ride sharing program, we can use this to further analyze busy periods going forward as well as soft periods that do not have a holiday.  March did not have any major holidays but still showed use in the urban areas, but lagged in the suburban and rural areas.  Depending on the school schedules, spring breaks may have had an influence.  If kids were out of school, they and their families may have gone on vacation impacting the use of the program explaining the lag of use for suburban and rural population areas as they would not be using them as much as people in urban areas during the weeks in March in particular.

This analysis and more like it can be useful in how the company campaigns in the differing population areas, how to garner more interest with potential drivers and increase its revenue overall making this type of analysis very important.
